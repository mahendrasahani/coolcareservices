                    <h5 class="fw-bold custom-text-color">
                        Tenure of Contract
                    </h5>
                    <p>Contract has a lock-in period that is equivalent to the tenure of the contact that has been chosen by the customer while placing the order. Contract shall not be terminated before the tenure. In case of early termination, the rent for agreed tenure has to be paid and a minimum of 1 weeks’ notice has to be given for pick-up. Similarly, the contract can be extended for a minimum period of 3 months by giving a notice, 1 week prior to the end of the contract.</p>
                    <h5 class="fw-bold custom-text-color">Payment policy</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li> The refundable deposit has to be paid in full online while placing an order.</li>
                        <li> There are no charges for pick-up. Extra charges may apply in case you do not have lift or permission to use the lift at your premises. This will be discussed before the delivery.</li>
                        <li> Billing cycle is 1st to 1st of the next month. Lessee will receive mails on the registered id on 1st of every month. First month’s rent will be calculated on pro-rata basis from the date of delivery to last day of the month.</li>
                        <li> Monthly rentals have to be paid online before 10th of every month (Due date) to avoid late payment charges of INR100. Refundable deposit does not include any monthly rent. It is simply a security deposit which takes care of the damages if any and also defaulters. Please note that the lessor has the right to physically retrieve the rented items in the event of default of monthly payments if not paid after 15 days of due date.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    <h5 class="fw-bold custom-text-color">Delivery policy</h5>

                        <li>Lessee or his/her representative has to be present at the agreed date and time. Otherwise extra shipping costs incurred i.e. INR 700 will be charged by the lessor.</li>

In case you do not have lift or permission to use lift at your premises, extra labor charges will be there to carry the products through stairs. If lessee himself wants to arrange the labor to carry the items through stairs he will have to bear any damage incurred during such shifting. Please note that in such cases, paid labor can be arranged by lessor at extra labor charges which should be discussed while placing the order.</li>
